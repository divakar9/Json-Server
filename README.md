# Json-Server

Creating Fake REST API

1. Open the command prompt.

2. Set the respective path and make sure that development environment includes Node.js and an npm package manager.

3. Install the Angular CLI with command "npm install -g @angular/cli".

4. Create a new workspace and project with command "ng new <project_name_folder>".

5. To easily build and serve your app locally use command "cd <project_name_folder>" and "ng serve --open".

6. Create another folder inside <project_name_folder> and set the path in the command prompt.

7. Use command "npm init" to create package.json file.

8. Use command "npm install --save json-server" to install the json server.

9. Now create db.json file to put all keys and values.

10. To run our server use command "npm run json:server" or "npm run json:server:remote". This will create a localhost where we can see our posts.
